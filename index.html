    	I've has been developing for the web since 1995. I remember the days before the Web was won - and some days, I get out and shine up my "This site best viewed on" badges... just in case.<br>
        <br>
        My current and previous clients include <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/welchcenter">Johns Hopkins University</a>, <a href="http://www.safesharkhosting.com">Safe Shark Hosting</a>, and <a href="http://www.ittybiz.com/">IttyBiz</a>. I have a special interest in seeing small, privately-owned businesses thrive, and in working on projects that don't fit the traditional mold. I spend much of my spare time working on experimental development and building toys that demonstrate proofs-of-concept.<br>
        <br>
        My recent projects include <strong>MassiveUpload</strong>, a WordPress plugin that allows users to upload large files directly through the WordPress interface; <strong>webinar software</strong> to allow live video and audio broadcasting across a media-server platform; and a <strong>post series</strong> WordPress plugin to streamline navigation between related posts.<br>

		<h3>I'm also available to work on retainer.</h3>
		<div id="retainer" class="service">
			Retaining my services as a developer means that your website is always under my watchful eye. I'll maintain your server and make sure that all of your web software is updated and ready to go, so that you don't have to worry about it - you'll be secure in the knowledge that someone's looking out for you.<br>

			<strong>At Level 2</strong> I'll keep a closer eye on things, check in twice a day (typially morning and evening), and perform some optimizations to make sure your website is running as smoothly as possible. A level 2 retainer is $3000 a month.<br><br>
			<strong>At Level 3</strong>, I'll be an on-call server administrator, with multiple check-ins each day, optimizations to keep your server going smoothly, and emergency services as required. A level 3 retainer is $7000 a month.
